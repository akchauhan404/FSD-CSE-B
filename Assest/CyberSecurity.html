    <h1>Cyber Security</h1>
    <p>
        Cybersecurity involves protecting computer systems, networks, and data from theft, damage, or unauthorized access.
    </p>
    <p>
        As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, organizations invest in multiple layers of security measures to protect sensitive information.
    </p>

        <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by disguising as trustworthy entities.</li>
        <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> Malware that locks or encrypts systems until a ransom is paid.</li>
        <li><strong>Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks:</strong> Overloading systems to disrupt services.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Security Practices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Regular software updates and patching.</li>
        <li>Strong password policies and multi-factor authentication.</li>
