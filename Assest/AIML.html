    <h1>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML)</h1>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks 
        that normally require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, decision-making, language understanding, 
        vision perception, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
        Machine Learning (ML), a subset of AI, involves algorithms and statistical models that allow computers to improve their 
        performance on a specific task through experience, without being explicitly programmed. It enables systems to learn patterns 
        from data and make predictions or decisions based on new inputs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Together, AIML technologies have enabled breakthroughs in various fields such as healthcare for diagnosing diseases, finance 
        for fraud detection, autonomous vehicles for navigation, and many other industries.
    </p>
    <h2>Applications of AIML</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> Understanding and generating human language, like chatbots and translators.</li>
        <li><strong>Computer Vision:</strong> Analyzing images and videos for facial recognition, medical imaging, and more.</li>
        <li><strong>Predictive Analytics:</strong> Forecasting trends and behaviors in business, marketing, and weather.</li>
        <li><strong>Robotics:</strong> Enabling robots to perform tasks autonomously in manufacturing, exploration, and service industries.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Benefits of AIML</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Automation of repetitive tasks, increasing efficiency.</li>
        <li>Enhanced decision-making through data-driven insights.</li>
        <li>Personalized user experiences in various applications.</li>
        <li>Innovation in products and services across many sectors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        As AIML continues to evolve, it promises to further transform how we live and work, bringing new challenges and opportunities.
