    <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
    <p>
        Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make decisions without explicit programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        It encompasses approaches like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
    </p>
    <h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> Learning from labeled data to make predictions.</li>
        <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Identifying patterns and groupings in unlabeled data.</li>
        <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> Learning optimal actions based on feedback from the environment.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Speech and image recognition.</li>
        <li>Spam detection in emails.</li>
        <li>Self-driving cars.</li>
        <li>Recommendation systems.</li>
    </ul>
