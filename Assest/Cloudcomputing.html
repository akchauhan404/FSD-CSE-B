    <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
    <p>
        Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, 
        analytics, and intelligence—over the internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.
    </p>
    <p>
        It provides on-demand access to computing power and resources, eliminating the need for organizations to invest heavily in physical hardware.
